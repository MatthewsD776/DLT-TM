# Third Generation Translation Memory

This project aims to combine the already well used and known Translation Memory with the new exciting Distributed Ledger Technology. This framework/network aims to be the place to work for every linguist by adding :

-  An Linguist identity
-  Standardizing the industry with a basic set of processes
-  Self-sovereignty of data within the Network (clearly defined ownership)
-  Secure by design
-  Open collaboration in expanding processes and standards

Please read the proposal which will outline more in-depth about how and why this is the next big thing. The project's proposal is [here](./Proposal/index "Proposal").
